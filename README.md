A Real-ESRGAN GUI.

The original software needs to call Batch command or Powershell command to run the optimization instruction, but I don't like to manually input every time, prefer to automate the execution, so I made this software to save time.

I've abandoned script splitting for now, but it's still supported for multiple languages.

## Design content

* [X] Multi-model optional optimization
* [x] Optional file optimization (here refers to the freedom to select images in any location)
* [ ] Optimize videos

## Precautions

To use it, name the image you want to optimize as input, with a png or jpg suffix (jpeg is not currently supported), and then choose the type you want to optimize. The output image is output.png

Note: Animation video optimization is video optimization to optimize the image, and only support png format.
