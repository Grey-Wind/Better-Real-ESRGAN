# Better Real-ESRGAN

A Real-ESRGAN GUI

This GUI supports jpg images optimized to png images

The original software required batch command or powershell command to run the optimization instructions, and I don't like the command box, so instead call CMD internally to run, the only drawback is that you can't see the progress in real time, this may be improved in future versions.

# Language

This software only have Chinese.

Please wait for more language support.
